 Solutions to exercises from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I am using the PDF copy of the book compiled courtesy of [Andres Raba](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf).
These solutions were written using the [Racket language](https://www.racket-lang.org/), though I saved them as .txt files.
